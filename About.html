  <h1>💪🏻 Becoming a product designer ...</h1>
  <p>I wasn't certain of what I wanted to do with my life before I started college. 
    Although I was accepted to UCSD as a psychology student, I quickly realized that it was not what I intended to do in the long term. 
    As I was browsing the list of majors one night, cognitive science, particularly the specialization in design and interaction, caught my attention. 
    The more I researched about the major, the more I became interested in it. 
    This is when I ultimately decided to change my major.
    <br><br>
    Since then, I've had the chance to join the <u>Diabetes Design Initiative Team at the UCSD Design Lab</u> and work as a product design intern at a start-up named <u>Astren</u>. 
    I also get to participate in several design-a-thons and joined a student organization named <u>Triton Software Engineering</u>, where we help non-profits design and develop software essentially for social good. 
    I had the opportunity to collaborate with specialists from several sectors, from interviewing possible stakeholders and professionals to cooperating with other designers and developers. 
    I still have no regrets about my decision after more than two years.
    <br><br>
    I believe good design <b>solves complex problems in a simple yet inclusive way that considers all identities</b>. 
    When creating for people, I keep the human-centered approach in mind in efforts to bridge the gaps between people and spur change in the world.
